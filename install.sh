# install.sh - A task runner for installing software and setting up the environment.
# It finds and executes all executable scripts in the 'tasks/' directory.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh            # Runs all tasks in alphabetical order.
#   ./install.sh neovim     # Runs only tasks with "neovim" in the filename.
#   ./install.sh --dry      # Lists the tasks that would run without executing them.

set -e # Exit immediately if a command fails

# Get the absolute path of the directory where this script is located
